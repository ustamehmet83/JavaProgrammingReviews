 For compiler one of the most important task is balanced brackets
            * Create a method that will accept a String of brackets. Determine if the brackets are balanced.
            Brackets are balanced if the closing bracket matches the opening one.

            Ex: {([])} -> balanced
                {[(])} -> not balanced
                use queue
                stack
