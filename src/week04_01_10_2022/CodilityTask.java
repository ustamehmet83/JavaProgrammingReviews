    Task 1:
  Write a function:
            that, given a positive integer N  However, any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5 should be replaced by the word

                                Codility -- 2
                                Test     -- 3
                                Coders   -- 5

            - If a number is divisible by more than one of the numbers:2,3 or 5, it should be replaced by a
            concatenation of the respective words Codility, Test and Coders in this given order.

                                EXPECTED

                        numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should be replac√©e by CodilityTest
                        INPUT : 6    OUTPUT :  CodilityTest

                        numbers divisible by allthree numbers: 2,3 and 5, should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.
